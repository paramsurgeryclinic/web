            <p class="que">1. What is a fissure and how is it caused?</p>

            <p class="ans">
              A fissure is a tear or crack in the skin, usually in the area of
              the anus or rectum. They can be caused by a variety of factors,
              including constipation, diarrhea, and straining during bowel
              movements.

            <p class="ans">
              Fissures are treated with methods such as increasing fiber and
              fluid intake, using stool softeners, taking sitz baths, and using
              topical creams or ointments. In some cases, surgery may be

            <p class="ans">
              To prevent fissures, it is important to maintain a healthy diet
              that includes a good balance of fiber, fruits, and vegetables and
              to drink enough fluids. Also avoiding constipation, anal
              intercourse and other behavior that can cause trauma on the anal
              area.

              as constipation, is not addressed. To prevent recurrence, it is
              important to maintain healthy bowel habits and to avoid straining
              during bowel movements.
