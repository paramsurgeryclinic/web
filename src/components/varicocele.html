          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">1. What causes varicoceles?</p>

            <p class="ans">
              Varicoceles are caused by a problem with the valves in the veins
              that drain the testicles. These valves usually keep blood flowing
              in the correct direction, but when they don't work properly, blood
              can flow backwards and pool in the veins, causing them to become
              dilated.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">2. What are the symptoms of varicoceles?</p>

            <p class="ans">
              Symptoms of Varicoceles can include a dull ache or heavy sensation
              in the testicles, a feeling of fullness in the scrotum, and a
              visible or palpable mass in the scrotum. However, many men with
              Varicoceles have no symptoms and the condition is discovered
              incidentally.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">3. Does Varicocele affect fertility?</p>

            <p class="ans">
              Varicoceles can have an effect on fertility. It's thought that the
              increased temperature and blood flow in the scrotum caused by
              Varicoceles may damage sperm, leading to decreased sperm quality.
              Additionally, the increased blood flow can also create hormonal
              imbalances in the testicles, which can further impact sperm
              production. Treating Varicocele may improve fertility and
              pregnancy rate.
            </p>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">4. How are Varicoceles diagnosed?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              Varicoceles are often diagnosed during a physical exam. The doctor
              will check for a mass or lump in the scrotum, or for a distinctive
              "bag of worms" appearance in the scrotum. They may also order an
              ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">5. How are Varicoceles treated?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              Treatment for Varicoceles can vary depending on the severity of
              the condition, but common options include surgery, embolization,
              and observation. In most cases, treatment is only considered if
              the Varicocele is causing significant symptoms, such as pain or
              infertility.

          <!-- <div class="question">
            <p class="que">6. Can a hydrocele resolve on its own?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              A hydrocele can resolve on its own, especially in infants.
              However, if it doesn't resolve within the first year of life,
              surgery may be necessary.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">
              7. Are there any complications associated with a hydrocele?
            </p>
            <p class="ans">
              In rare cases, a hydrocele can become infected, which can lead to
              further complications. If a hydrocele is caused by an underlying
              condition, such as testicular cancer, it may also be important to
              address that condition as well.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">8. When should I see a doctor for a hydrocele?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              If you notice a painless swelling in one or both testicles, you
              should see a doctor. Also, if the swelling is painful, is getting
              bigger, or is accompanied by fever or other symptoms, you should
              see a doctor as soon as possible.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">9. Is a hydrocele considered a serious condition?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              Hydroceles are generally not considered to be serious condition,
              but if it causes discomfort, impacts on daily activities or is
              caused by underlying disease then it can become serious.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">10. Are hydroceles common in infants?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              Hydroceles are common in newborns, affecting about 1 in 25 male
              infants. However, most hydroceles in infants resolve on their own
              within the first year of life.
