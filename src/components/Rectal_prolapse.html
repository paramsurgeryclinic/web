            <p class="ans">
              Rectal prolapse is a condition in which the rectum (the last part
              of the large intestine) falls down or protrudes out of the anus.
              It can occur in both adults and children, and can be caused by a
              variety of factors such as chronic constipation, weakened pelvic
              muscles, nerve damage, and chronic diseases such as cystic
              fibrosis, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries

          </div>

            <p class="que">2. What are the symptoms of rectal prolapse?</p>

              Symptoms of rectal prolapse include rectal pain, bleeding,

              such as chronic constipation, is not fully addressed. To prevent
              recurrence, it is important to maintain good bowel habits, and to
              follow the recommended treatment plan.
