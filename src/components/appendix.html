              The most common symptom of appendicitis is abdominal pain that
              begins near the navel and then moves to the lower right side of
              the abdomen. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, loss of

            <p class="ans">
              The most common treatment for appendicitis is surgical removal of
              the appendix, called an appendectomy. This is typically done as
              soon as possible to prevent the appendix from rupturing, which can
              lead to serious complications.

            <p class="ans">
              Appendicitis is typically diagnosed through a combination of a

            <p class="ans">
              In rare cases, a hydrocele can become infected, which can lead to
              further complications. If a hydrocele is caused by an underlying
              condition, such as testicular cancer, it may also be important to
              address that condition as well.
