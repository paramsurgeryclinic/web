          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">1. What is a hydrocele?</p>

            <p class="ans">
              A hydrocele is a collection of fluid in a thin sac within the
              scrotum, the sac that surrounds the testicles. This fluid buildup
              can cause the scrotum to swell. Hydroceles can develop in both men
              and infants, but they are most common in newborns and older men.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">2. What are the symptoms of a hydrocele?</p>

            <p class="ans">
              The main symptom of a hydrocele is a painless swelling in one or
              both testicles. The scrotum may feel heavy and the swelling may
              get bigger during the day and smaller at night.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">3. What causes a hydrocele?</p>

            <p class="ans">
              In adults, hydroceles can be caused by injury, infection, or
              inflammation in the testicles or epididymis, or it can be a side
              effect of surgery. In infants, it is caused by the failure of the
              processus vaginalis, a tube that connects the abdominal cavity to
              the scrotum during fetal development, to close properly after
              birth.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">4. How is a hydrocele diagnosed?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              A hydrocele is usually diagnosed by physical examination and
              medical history. In some cases, ultrasound or other imaging tests
              may be needed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">5. How is a hydrocele treated?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              Treatment for hydrocele depends on the underlying cause, if any,
              and the size and symptoms of the hydrocele. In some cases it will
              resolve on its own, while in others it can be treated surgically
              by drainage of the fluid or removal of the sac and in some cases
              may require antibiotics or pain medication.

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">6. Can a hydrocele resolve on its own?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              A hydrocele can resolve on its own, especially in infants.
              However, if it doesn't resolve within the first year of life,
              surgery may be necessary.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">
              7. Are there any complications associated with a hydrocele?
            </p>
            <p class="ans">
              In rare cases, a hydrocele can become infected, which can lead to
              further complications. If a hydrocele is caused by an underlying
              condition, such as testicular cancer, it may also be important to
              address that condition as well.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">8. When should I see a doctor for a hydrocele?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              If you notice a painless swelling in one or both testicles, you
              should see a doctor. Also, if the swelling is painful, is getting
              bigger, or is accompanied by fever or other symptoms, you should
              see a doctor as soon as possible.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">9. Is a hydrocele considered a serious condition?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              Hydroceles are generally not considered to be serious condition,
              but if it causes discomfort, impacts on daily activities or is
              caused by underlying disease then it can become serious.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">10. Are hydroceles common in infants?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              Hydroceles are common in newborns, affecting about 1 in 25 male
              infants. However, most hydroceles in infants resolve on their own
              within the first year of life.
