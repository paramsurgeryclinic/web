            <p class="ans">
              Piles are swollen and inflamed veins in the rectum and anus. They

            <p class="ans">
              Symptoms of Piles can include itching, pain, rectal bleeding, and

            <p class="ans">
              Piles are typically caused by increased pressure in the rectal and
