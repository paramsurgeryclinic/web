          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">1. What causes a hernia?</p>

            <p class="ans">
              A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body, such as the
              intestine, pushes through a weakness or tear in the muscle or
              tissue that holds it in place. Hernias can be caused by a variety
              of factors, including strain on the muscles due to heavy lifting,
              chronic coughing, obesity, and a congenital weakness in the muscle
              or tissue.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">2. How is a hernia diagnosed?</p>

            <p class="ans">
              A hernia is typically diagnosed through a physical examination, in
              which a doctor will feel for a lump or bulge in the area where the
              hernia is suspected. In some cases, additional tests, such as an
              X-ray or CT scan, may be used to confirm the diagnosis
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">3. What are the symptoms of a hernia?</p>

            <p class="ans">
              The most common symptom of a hernia is a lump or bulge in the
              affected area, which may be accompanied by pain or discomfort.
              Other symptoms can include a feeling of heaviness or pressure in
              the affected area, and a burning or aching sensation.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">4. How is a hernia treated?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              The most common treatment for a hernia is surgery, which involves
              repairing the tear or weakness in the muscle or tissue that is
              causing the hernia. In some cases, a hernia can be treated with a
              truss, which is a device worn over the hernia to keep the internal
              part of the body in place.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">5. Are hernias dangerous?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              Hernias are generally not considered to be dangerous, but they can
              cause discomfort and pain. In rare cases, a hernia can become
              strangulated, which means that the blood supply to the part of the
              body that is pushing through the tear or weakness is cut off.
              Strangulated hernias can be life-threatening and require immediate
              medical attention.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">6. Can a hernia heal on its own?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              Hernias typically do not heal on their own. Treatment is generally
              needed to repair the tear or weakness in the muscle or tissue that
              is causing the hernia.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">7. What is the recovery time for hernia surgery?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              Recovery time for hernia surgery varies depending on the type of
              surgery and the individual patient. Most people are able to return
              to normal activities within a few weeks of surgery, although some
              may take longer.
            </p>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">
              8. Are there any complications associated with hernia surgery?
            </p>
            <p class="ans">
              Complications from hernia surgery are rare, but they can occur.
              Complications can include infection, bleeding, and reactions to
              anesthesia.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">9. Are there any natural remedies for a hernia?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              There is no evidence that natural remedies can cure a hernia.
              Surgery is typically needed to repair the tear or weakness in the
              muscle or tissue that is causing the hernia.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">10. Can hernias recur after surgery?</p>
            <p class="ans">
              Hernias can recur after surgery, although this is not very common.
              The risk of recurrence may be higher if the underlying condition
              that caused the hernia is not addressed, such as obesity, chronic
              coughing or heavy lifting.
