          <div class="question">
            <p class="que">1. What is laparoscopy?</p>

            <p class="ans">
              Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that uses a thin, lighted tube
              called a laparoscope, which is inserted through a small incision
              in the abdomen. The laparoscope is equipped with a camera that
              allows the surgeon to view the inside of the abdomen on a monitor.

              procedure. Your surgeon will provide specific instructions and
              will also discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure with
              you.
